The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [April 10, Monday, 2023].

## Log

### R1D1 
I'm working on a coding challenge by frontendmentor.io on a multi-step form.

### R1D2
I'm on the second page and was able to resolve the toggle switch  button with html/css for yearly or monthly subscription.

### R1D3 
I will be working on the 'next step' and 'go back' buttons today

### R1D4
I worked on the 'Pick add-ons page using display flex and justify content to arrange the contents the way they look on the original work. Spent about an hour or less on that.
